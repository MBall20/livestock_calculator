# Overview


My goal with this project was to work more with object oriented programming to create a calculator to accurately estimate the weight of cattle on any given date. Currently the crowth rate per day is set at an average so that I could focus on the programming. But through further research I will be able to get more specific rates depending on the stage in life and combine all the rates together for more accuracy. This will allow for tentetive timelines to be set to maximize growth and profit when it comes time to sell.

My overall organization was not the greatest because this was intended to practice different aspects of the C++ language. It is rough around the edges, but has taught me the essentials. One example of this would be the usage of two different implementations of an if statement; if else, and using the shorthand ?. This software implements anything from the simple cout (print) statements to functions and classes.

# Development Environment

I started coding in Visual Studio, but switch over to replit online IDE when I can into some errors with Visual Studio not liking some fo the predefined functions I used to find the current date.

* Visual Studio: IDE
* Replite: IDE
* MinGW (GCC): Complier

* Language: C++

##### Libraries:
* iostream
* sstream
* string
* cmath
* map

# Future Work


* Configure user input to be save as dates rather than simply integers
* Improve User Validation
* More precise growth rates depending on stage in life
